# Introduction #

Adding the PEAR XML\_RSS library to your PHP include directory is relatively easy with PEAR. If you're not using the `smarty_helper.sh` script, you can manually add this with the following:

```
$> pear upgrade pear
$> pear install --onlyreqdeps DB
$> pear install --onlyreqdeps XML_RSS
```

Ok, if you're paying attention, I also added the DB pear library in there, but you need it too :)
